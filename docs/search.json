This is where you communicate with R. You can type directly into this pane, but it is usually better to work within the editor pane, because that way you can easily correct mistakes and try again.\nThe two right-hand panes contain a variety of tabs. In the figure, the top pane is showing the Environment Pane (i.e. the workspace), and the bottom pane is showing a plot.\n\nFor now, you just need to know the following points:\n\nYou should do most of your work in the editor, but you can occasionally type in the console.\nThe console pane displays what R is doing.\nAll of the panes can be resized and repositioned, so sometimes it may appear that you’ve lost one, but there’s no need to worry: just find the header of the pane and click there with your mouse, and the pane will reappear. If the pane is there but the content isn’t what you want, try clicking on the tabs at the top."
